feat: add real-time Stripe sync monitoring with manual client connection

Frontend integration for enhanced Stripe sync service with comprehensive UX improvements:

Real-time Sync Monitoring:
- Add ClientSyncStatus component with live progress tracking and toast notifications
- Implement usePortalRealtimeData hook for Supabase real-time portal updates
- Show detailed sync progress (created/synced/failed counts) with visual progress bar
- Persist toast notifications across page refreshes until user dismisses
- Store dismissal state in database to prevent notification reappearance

Manual Client Connection:
- Add "Connect to Stripe" button in ClientTable dropdown for individual client sync
- Enable manual connection for failed syncs to avoid full re-sync
- Hide manual connection option during active bulk sync operations

UX/Performance Improvements:
- Fix usePortalClientData flickering by preventing unnecessary refetches on portal changes
- Add new Stripe connection status column to client table
- Integrate Sonner toast library for better notification management
- Add responsive styling for sync status indicators and progress components

Technical Changes:
- Implement real-time subscription management for portal data
- Add toast container styling and configuration
- Update Client.jsx to use real-time portal data integration
- Add sonner dependency for enhanced toast notifications

This provides users with full visibility into sync operations and recovery options
for partial sync failures without disrupting existing workflows.
